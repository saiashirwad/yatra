# yatra

A playground for exploring ideas for a new, type-safe ORM for typescript.

asdf

show me how to use vim motions that can help me take the following:


const hi = () => {
	console.log("inside function hi")
}
const that = () => {
	console.log("inside function that")
}


and turn it into:

const has = () => {
	console.log("inside function has")
}

const a = 1;
const b = 2;
const c = 3;
const d = 4;
const e = 5;

the fastest way possible
